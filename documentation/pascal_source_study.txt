This file contains information about the older Pascal program. It is currently
being gone through in order to determine what the majority of it means/does. I
will be translating what the Procedures do and along with the variables and
constants of the program.

Procedures progress:

HeadOut - incomplete
GetKneeI - incomplete
GetKnee - incomplete
GetHandI - incomplete
GetHand - incomplete
Max - incomplete
Knee - incomplete
Hand - incomplete
Both - done
Main - done

Data:

constants:

int M0 5
Appears nowhere in the code. Possible hard-coded thing to add padding in memory?

int N 132
Total number of indicators
Is used to declare arrays that contain the data and for moving through
them in the Max procedure. Appears nowhere else in the code.

int MKNEE 1
Index location for knee indicators in the array.
It is used in the GetKnee, HeadIn, Knee, and Both Procedures. It is used to
set I and I1 for index values to go through the arrays.

int NKNEE 34

int MHW 35

int NHW 132

int NGRADED 119

int MREGR 120

int NREGR 132

int array M size NGRADED
Contains the max value for each indicator.

real array P size 264 by 5

real array Y size N by 2

real array Z size N by 2

string array KD size 6 by 2

string array ID size N
Contains all the strings for the indicators, used to print out to the screen.
Deprecated

real array C size 6 by 6

int array XY size N by 2
This array contains the screen locations for an IBM PC.
Deprecated

of the current run, such as which measurements to take (hand or knee or both).

Procedures:
The procedures will be translated into pseudo code in their current form. This will
allow for an easy look at the procedures and let use see which ones, or what, we
will port over. I think I will use the current variable names for the pseudo code,
but they are being documented to determine what is needed and for refactoring
purposes.
